# The Shutter Shop — Starter

This is a minimal starter skeleton for The Shutter Shop fullstack Website.

Backend:
- Express + Mongoose (backend/server.js)
- Product routes at /api/products

Frontend:
- React + Redux (Vite friendly)
- Basic pages: HomePage, ProductPage, CollectionPage

To run:
1. Install Node and MongoDB.
2. From project root: `npm install`
3. From project root: `npm run start` (or `npm run start:dev` if using nodemon)
4. Frontend: `cd frontend && npm install && npm run start` (Vite dev server)

This is intentionally minimal — use as a starting point.
